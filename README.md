Overview of the Project:
Project:SIMPLE CALCULATOR
The SimpleCalculator program is a console-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.
 Objectives of the SimpleCalculator Program

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:
   - Enable users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. User Interaction:
   - Provide an interactive console interface for users to input numbers and select operations.

3. Input Validation:
   - Ensure that user input is handled correctly, including:
     - Validating the choice of arithmetic operations.
     - Handling division by zero gracefully.

4. Result Display:
   - Clearly display the result of the calculations to the user.

5. Resource Management:
   - Properly manage resources by closing the `Scanner` object after use to prevent memory leaks.

 Educational Objectives

1. Learn Basic Java Syntax:
   - Familiarize users with Java programming constructs such as variables, operators, conditionals, and loops.

2. Understand Data Types:
   - Illustrate the use of different data types (e.g., `double` for numeric input) in Java.

3. Practice Control Structures:
   - Utilize control structures like `switch` statements for decision-making based on user input.

4. Implement Exception Handling:
   - Demonstrate how to manage potential errors (like invalid input) in a user-friendly manner.

5. Encourage Good Programming Practices:
   - Emphasize the importance of closing resources and maintaining code readability.

     Technologies Used in the SimpleCalculator Program

1. Java Programming Language:
   - The entire application is written in Java, a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its portability and strong object-oriented features.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK):
   - The Java Development Kit is required to compile and run Java programs. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), libraries, and development tools.

3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (optional):
   - While not mandatory, many developers use IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code to write and debug their Java code. These tools provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging support.

4. Java Standard Library:
   - The program uses the `java.util.Scanner` class from the Java Standard Library to handle user input. This library provides a simple way to read input from various sources, including the console.

Basic Console I/O:
   - The application interacts with the user via standard input (keyboard) and output (console). This is a fundamental aspect of many command-line applications.

Overall Goal
The main goal of the SimpleCalculator program is to provide a straightforward tool for performing basic calculations while teaching essential programming concepts in Java. This serves as a foundational exercise for beginners learning to code.
